    <h4>Soteria House is a Therapeutic Community Residence for the prevention of hospitalization for individuals experiencing a distressing extreme state, commonly referred to as psychosis. We believe that psychosis can be a temporary experience that one works through rather than a chronic mental illness that needs to be managed. 

        We practice the approach of “being with” – this is a process of actively staying present with people and learning about their experiences. Soteria believes in the power of each individual’s wisdom and intuition and we believe that strong relationships provide opportunities for powerful transformation. 
        
        Soteria House provides:
