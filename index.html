    <h3>Evidence Based Care for Folks Experiencing Psychosis</h3>
</div>
</header>
<main class="item-b">
    <h4>Soteria House is a Therapeutic Community Residence for the prevention of hospitalization for individuals experiencing a distressing extreme state, commonly referred to as psychosis. We believe that psychosis can be a temporary experience that one works through rather than a chronic mental illness that needs to be managed. 

        We practice the approach of “being with” – this is a process of actively staying present with people and learning about their experiences. Soteria believes in the power of each individual’s wisdom and intuition and we believe that strong relationships provide opportunities for powerful transformation. 
        
        Soteria House provides:
            
            </h4>
    <ul><li> A safe, non-restrictive, home-like environment.</li>
        <li>Flexible, non-judgmental, person-centered services.</li>
        <li>Specialized, inter personally-driven support</li>
        <li>24-hour staffing
            Coordination with community services providers and other resources, such as housing, education and employment assistance</li>
        <li>Six months of aftercare support</li>
        <li>Optional psychiatric consultation</li>
    
    </ul>
    <h3>Creating Alternatives in the System of Care</h3>
    <p>The predominant treatment available for initial experiences of psychosis entails the prescription of antipsychotic (aka neuroleptic) medications and inpatient hospitalization. However, a significant portion of individuals going through the experience are not interested in this form of treatment and alternative forms of care are not readily accessible, especially to those with limited resources.

        Soteria offers an alternative approach to the experience of psychosis by providing person-centered adaptive care. Soteria has on-site psychiatry, but treats psychiatric medication as a personal choice and offers alternative modalities, including dream-work, breathwork, herbalism, and meditation.</p>
